These days I'm living in the suburbs of Long Island NY having been captured by 3 teens and a dog.  They only let me out to work.  As you can see they are brutal captors.

I'm honestly far more a fan of the mountains than of being trapped on an island, but I bought an inflatable kayak last year and I'm looking forward to getting it out on the water and enjoying my location more than I have in the decade I've been here.

I'm trying to get back to my creative and more philosophical days by doing more writing and drawing, but honestly the technical aspect of building projects like this blog are what really captures my attention and imagination.  

I just can't stop finding new ways to play with <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com" target="_blank">Tiddlywiki.</a>

I currently work as a registered respiratory therapist at two hospitals west of where I live, closer to NYC.  I do mainly emergency and critical care so I'm frequently a part of the worst time in a person's life.

I aspire to live the van life!
